# amo-urdf

Amo-urdf is a fork of the no-longer-updated [`odio-urdf` ](https://github.com/hauptmech/odio_urdf). All the elements of the repository are preserved. The difference is the support for additional tags from `MuJoCo` and `Gazebo`. Additionally a few [minor bugs](https://github.com/hauptmech/odio_urdf/issues/16) have been fixed.
